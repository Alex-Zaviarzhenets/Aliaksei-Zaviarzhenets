<p> An electric bicycle (e-bike, eBike, etc.) is a motorized bicycle with an integrated
    electric motor used to assist propulsion. Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide, 
    but they generally fall into two broad categories: bikes that assist the rider's pedal-
    power (i.e. pedelecs) and bikes that add a throttle, integrating moped-style functionality.
    Both retain the ability to be pedaled by the rider and are therefore not electric motorcycles. 
    E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and typically are motor-powered up to 25 to 32 km/h (16 to 20 mph).
    High-powered varieties can often travel more than 45 km/h (28 mph).

    <p>A hybrid bike starts with a traditional road bike platform: fast-rolling 700c wheels and 
    a lightweight, efficient frame. But while a road bike typically comes outfitted with a drop bar, 
    a hybrid bike’s signature feature is a flat handlebar. This provides a wide hand stance for better 
    control, easy brake-lever access, and a more upright position that’s comfortable and conducive 
    to looking over a shoulder in traffic. These are just a few of the reasons why new cyclists 
    and commuters are often drawn to this type of bike.</p>

    <p>A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered assisted, 
        pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider 
        is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.
        Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century there were more than
        1 billion.[1][2][3] These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number 
        of individual models produced.[4][5][6] They are the principal means of transportation in many regions.  
        They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys,
        general fitness, military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts.
        The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or "safety bicycle", has changed little since the 
        first chain-driven model was developed around 1885.[7][8][9] However, many details have been improved,
        especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a 
        proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling. In the 21st century electric bicycles 
        have become popular.
        The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing 
        modern industrial methods. Several components that played a key role in the development of the automobile 
        were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets 
        tension-spoked wheels.[10]</p>
